Given the lack of specific implementation details in the provided `server.go` file, I'll assume a generic HTTP server setup in Go for creating tests. This HTTP server would typically include functionalities such as starting the server, handling requests, and gracefully shutting down. I'll craft a set of comprehensive unit tests considering a basic setup where the server handles GET requests and returns a fixed response. We'll use Go's `testing` package and `httptest` for simulating server responses, along with a mock library like `gomock` for mocking any external dependencies.

**Note:** Actual implementation details of `server.go` would significantly influence the testing code. Since those details are missing, the following code is based on common functionalities expected from an HTTP server in Go.

```go
package http_test

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"testing"
	"time"

	"github.com/golang/mock/gomock"
	"example.com/project/src/net/http"
)

// Mock external dependencies if any, e.g., a Logger or a Database interface.

func TestServer_StartAndServe(t *testing.T) {
	// Setup
	server := http.NewServer() // Assuming NewServer is a constructor for our server.
	ts := httptest.NewServer(server.HandleRequests()) // This simulates server responses.
	defer ts.Close()

	// Test cases
	tests := []struct {
		name           string
		url            string
		expectedStatus int
		expectedBody   string
	}{
		{"RootPath", "/", http.StatusOK, "Hello, World!"},
		{"NotFound", "/not-found", http.StatusNotFound, "404 page not found"},
	}

	for _, tc := range tests {
		t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			resp, err := http.Get(ts.URL + tc.url)
			if err != nil {
				t.Fatalf("could not send GET request: %v", err)
			}
			defer resp.Body.Close()

			if resp.StatusCode != tc.expectedStatus {
				t.Errorf("expected status %d; got %d", tc.expectedStatus, resp.StatusCode)
			}

			body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
			if err != nil {
				t.Fatalf("could not read response body: %v", err)
			}

			if string(body) != tc.expectedBody {
				t.Errorf("expected body %q; got %q", tc.expectedBody, string(body))
			}
		})
	}
}

func TestServer_Stop(t *testing.T) {
	// Assuming Stop is implemented to gracefully shut down the server.
	server := http.NewServer() // Constructor for our server.
	go func() {
		if err := server.Start(":8080"); err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("server failed to start: %v", err)
		}
	}()
	time.Sleep(time.Second) // Wait a bit for the server to start.

	err := server.Stop()
	if err != nil {
		t.Errorf("server failed to stop gracefully: %v", err)
	}
	// No easy way to test from outside if the server has stopped without making an HTTP request,
	// which would fail if the server has correctly stopped.
}

// More tests can be added to cover other functionalities like request handling logic, error scenarios, etc.
```

**Explanation:** This test code covers basic cases for a hypothetical HTTP server, including starting the server, handling a couple of request paths, and stopping the server. It uses `httptest` for simulating HTTP requests and responses, which is a common approach for testing HTTP servers in Go. Depending on the actual functionalities and complexities in `server.go`, more detailed tests including error cases, edge cases, and mocking external dependencies would be necessary to achieve high code coverage and ensure robustness.
